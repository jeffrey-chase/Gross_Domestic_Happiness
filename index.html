        The dataset used to generate this visualization comes from the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/" target="_blank"> 2019 World Happiness Report </a> (data sources: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2019/Chapter2OnlineData.xls"> 2018</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness">2015-17</a>) produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
      </p>

      <p> The project involved a survey of people's personal subjective happiness in 155 countries around the world from 2015&mdash;2018. A total happiness score was generated for each country by taking these personal ratings (on an ordinal scale of 1&mdash;10) and then aggregating them. </p>

      <p> This variable was then compared to various country-level predictors of a country's happiness to score and each variable was then normalized based on its predicted contribution to the happiness score. Note that as they are scored based on their relation to the happiness score, the variables are not in their original values.</p>

      <p>These are the six predictors that they identified and scored:</p>
      <p><b>1. Economy:</b> measured as the country's gross domestic product per capita</p>
      <p><b>2. Family:</b> measured as the level of social support</p>
      <p><b>3. Health: </b>measured as the average life expectancy of the country's population</p>
      <p><b>4. Freedom:</b> measured from survey questions on whether people felt satisified with their levels of personal freedom</p>
      <p><b>5. Generosity:</b> measured by comparing GDP per capita to the proportion of people who reported donating to a charity</p>
      <p><b>6. Trust:</b> measured by the proportion of people who view the government or businesses as corrupt</p>
